  title: "Coding with Web Standards"
  keynote: false
  extract: >
    Designing with Web Standard by Jeffrey Zeldman changed the way we built websites at the beginning of 2000. This amazing book helped front-end developers (called web designers at the time) to understand how and why using the correct tags and approaches it's a good idea. A lot of time passed and Web Standards continue to evolve. Are we embracing them or are we fighting them?
    During this talk, we'll hurl back to 2000 and then return to our days on a trip full of standards,  less-standard things, weird web nostalgia moments and the secret for a better web.

  title: "Accessibility-flavored React components make your design system delicious!"
  keynote: false
  extract: >
    Design systems are a popular way for teams to flavor their design and development workflow. However, an often-missing ingredient in many design systems is a focus on accessibility best practices — especially when component libraries are involved. 
    In this talk, we’ll take a look at how you can mix some commonly-used components with the ingredients of accessibility. Pair this with best practices guidance in your documentation, and you’ll have the recipe for a delectably inclusive design system.
